# Student Management System (Java OOP)

## Introduction
This Java application is a Student Management System designed with the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It serves as an educational tool to manage student records efficiently.

## Features
- **Student Enrollment**: Enroll new students with details such as name, ID, and course enrollment.
- **Record Management**: Add, update, and delete student records.
- **Grade Tracking**: Input and manage student grades for various courses.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on student performance and enrollment statistics.

## OOP Concepts Utilized
- **Encapsulation**: Private data fields with public getters and setters.
- **Inheritance**: Class hierarchies that represent different user roles.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods that behave differently based on the object that invokes them.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces that define template methods and behaviors.

## Getting Started
To run the Student Management System, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Compile the source files and execute the main class:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
